# TechieYouth
This repository is created and made by Amimul Arnab to showcase all my work and exercises and unit assessments that involves programming for TechieYouth organization

Create a written piece about Techie Youth and your experience with the Learn to E-Earn program, or write about one of the causes that Techie Youth aims to help (reference www.TechieYouth.org to learn about our causes,)

You may write it in the style of writing that you prefer. Some examples include:

For copywriting style, create an advertisement, public service announcement (PSA) or a promotional campaign
For a blog, publish a blog post
For a magazine article, write your article that includes a newsworthy twist, and submit it for publishing to the magazines/journals of your choice. Extra-credit if it gets published.
Use your creativity and research skills to make your writing piece a memorable one.

For this unit assessment, I created a word document which can also be found here. Then converted the word document into an html file so I can create a link for the website. 
All work can be found here.
