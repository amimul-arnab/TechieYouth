                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p> We are Techie Youth, a non-profit organization that helps foster children and in danger & at-risk youth 
                    children to develop them professionals to thrive in modern day world. Techie Youth focuses mainly on 
                    at-risk youth populations who are facing extreme life-challenges and those who are in guidance 
                    and assistance to learn how to become financially independent. Many students in our 
                    organization were statistically likely to become homeless or incarcerated. Knowing those odds, 
                    we have helped thousands of students alter their life to become independent adults with our 
                    services. With over 3,000+ students with locations throughout NYC including Long Island City, 
                    Bushwick, Brooklyn and locations in Long Island, techie youth provide an urban workplace for 
                    the youth and many of the students are seen on TV such as Fox 5, Pix 11 and abc channel for 
                    their outstanding work. To learn more, watch this video.

                    Our organization offers a variety of skills to teach. We understand many of you are not sure what 
                    you want to do with your life. In fact, you are all teenagers, so it's not expected for you to have 
                    everything figured out. And a lot of teenagers are very lost in life with no moral nor financial 
                    support from anyone. We believe that teenagers are the future of the world that will advance the 
                    world to a new age. Most teenagers need the right guidance and support and that is what we are 
                    here for.
